# Getting Started with 111 Integration Adaptor Test Suite

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start Scripts

In the project directory, you should run the following to start the app:

# test - remove
### `npm install`

Runs the dependency installation process.\
Open the directory in your terminal and run the command.

The project will begin with installation of required dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode, run this once you have installed dependencies.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
Ensure the dependencies have been installed before running this or build will fail.
